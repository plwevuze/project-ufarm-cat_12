let you =" are the reason";
//   Declared a variable "you" that is limited to only the above block of code using a keyword "let"
//   and assigned it a string value "are the reason"

var we = " the next generation of programmer";
//   Declared a variable "we" globaly using a keyword "var"
//   and assigned it a string value " the next generation of programmer"

const us = ' we are upcoming software problem solvers';
//   Declared a constant variable "us" using a keyword "const"
//   and assigned it a string value " we are upcoming software problem solvers"

let num1 = 5;
//   Declared a variable "num1" that is limited to only the above block of code using a keyword "let"
//   and assigned it a value "5"

let num2 = 10;
//   Declared a variable "num2" that is limited to only the above block of code using a keyword "let"
//   and assigned it a value "10"

let num3 = num2 += num1;
//   Declared a variable "num3" that is limited to only the above block of code using a keyword "let"
//   and assigned it a value of the sum of variables "num2" and "num1" thus it returns the sum of 10 and 5 wich is 15.

let ans = num1 % num2;
//   Declared a variable "ans" that is limited to only the above block of code using a keyword "let"
//   and assigned it the value of the remainder of dividing the value of the variable "num1" by the value of the variable "num2" using the modulas operator.
//   Hence this returns  the value of ans as "5"

console.log(ans);
//   This prints out the value of the variable "ans"at that instance.

console.log(num3 *= 2);
//   This prints out the product of variable "num3" and "2" and returns the "15"

var num4;
//   Declared a variable "num4" globaly using a keyword "var" without initialization or
//   no value assigned to it 

console.log(num4);
//prints out the value of the variable "num4"

console.log(2num6);
//    This returns an error  while running the code  as it tries to print the value of a variable
//    but the variable name begins with a number and a variable name should not begin with a number or even a special character.

var ans = 'this is not right';
//    This returns an error  while running the code because the variable name "ans" is already declared and assigned a value.

var let ='do you know what you are doing?';
//   Declared a variable name  "let" which is a keyword in javascript. and assigned it a string value "do you know what you are doing?"
//   in practice, its not advisable to use a keyword to declare a variable.

const dad;
//    Declared the constant  variable "dad"  with a keyword "const" but no value assigned to it/initialised.

const myNum = num1>num2? num3:us;
//    Declared a variable with the name "myNum" and assign it the same value as that of the variable num3 if the value in num1 is greater
//    than the value in num2 and if not then assign it the same value in  the variable us.

console.log(--num3);
//    This is a pre-decrement that decreases the value of num3 by 1 before printing it

console.log(num3);
//    This prints out or returns the value of num3

console.log(num3++);
//    This is a post-increment that increases the value of num3 by 1 before printing it

console.log(num2 != num3);
//    This is a boolean statement that prints either "true" or "false" in case the value in nam2 is  not equal to the value in nam3.
//    For this care it returns "true"

console.log(num3 !=num2 && num2==num2);
//    this is a boolean statement that returns true or false if the value in num3 is not equal to the value in num2 
//    and also the value in num2 is equal to the value in num2 hence for this care it returns "true"

if(100>=200){
	const num2 =20;
	console.log('you are now a junior developer');
}
//    If 100 is greater than 200, assign the num2 variable with a constant value "20" and after return a string "you are now a junior developer"
//    but the condition is not true so nothing will be returned
