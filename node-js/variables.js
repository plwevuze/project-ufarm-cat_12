//variable syntax
//use let,var,const---always in small letters wen u are declearing a variable
//never declare a variable twice
//== means an assignment operator
// wen using 'const' it must never be left empty
//variable names shouldnt start with a number/figure or special characters ie #$%^&@! etc
//variable names shudnt have space inbetween then
//use relatable variable names
//endevour to terminate with  a semi-colon
//use an underscore (_) or a carmel notation (ie. uppercase) in case a variable name has more than two words
//not advisable to start/end the name of the variable with an upper case but can be used within for compound name
//white spaces are allowed in  programming
//endevour to write comments in ur code
